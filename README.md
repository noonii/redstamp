# Note

1. It's a partial site that is not meant to be completed, except for the 'newsletter page' inside the dashboard. 
2. Feel free to browse through the scripts, though.

# Assignment
- Things we want to see.  <br>
 responsive <br>
 minimum one SVG image working. <br>
 well written, scalable code (Always room to improve, really) <br>
 cross browser tested

# Instructions *important*

1. Import redstamp.sql
2. Change database configurations in redstamp/core/config.class.php to your suited settings!
3. Run site on localhost

*Note*
- For checking responsiveness, I used F12 -> Top left corner (phone/tablet settings) 
 <br>OR Ctrl+Shift+M (must be pressed at the same time)

# Frameworks/Libraries Used

core/db.class.php <br>
resources/assets/sass/mixins/_fonts.scss <br>
resources/assets/sass/vendor <br>
resources/assets/sass/waves.scss <br>
assets/fonts <br>
node_modules
bootstrap

Used vanilla JS instead of jQuery because I want to get better at it. I've used jQuery so much that I want to learn raw JS.

# Custom Files
- Pages self-coded for the redstamp assignment from scratch
- Did not use a template or an existing project
