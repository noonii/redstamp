# redstamp

#Instructions *important*

1. Import redstamp.sql
2. Change database configurations in redstamp/core/config.class.php to your suited settings!
3. Run site on localhost

*Note*
- For checking responsiveness, I used F12 -> Top left corner (phone/tablet settings) OR Ctrl+Shift+M (must be pressed at the same time)
