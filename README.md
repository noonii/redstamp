# redstamp

Time taken:
- newsletter : 2-3 Hours 
- rest of site back-end/front-end 5-8 hours 

When you face bugs sometimes the smallest things take forever to find. 

I know that the instructions were to do the newsletter, but I realized I wouldn't have a second chance to show some of what I am capable of. So, I decided to take this opportunity to showcase my work in raw form without using backend frameworks I'm most famliar with like (WordPress/Laravel). If you want to see that, then visit www.ovatiq.com 

# Instructions *important*

1. Import redstamp.sql
2. Change database configurations in redstamp/core/config.class.php to your suited settings!
3. Run site on localhost

*Note*
- For checking responsiveness, I used F12 -> Top left corner (phone/tablet settings) 
 <br>OR Ctrl+Shift+M (must be pressed at the same time)

# Assignment
- Things we want to see.  <br>
 ✔ responsive <br>
 ✔ minimum one SVG image working. <br>
 ✔ well written, scalable code (Always remove to improve as a Junior) <br>
 ✔ cross browser tested


# Frameworks/Libraries Used

core/db.class.php <br>
resources/assets/sass/mixins/_fonts.scss <br>
resources/assets/sass/vendor <br>
resources/assets/sass/waves.scss <br>
assets/fonts <br>
node_modules
bootstrap

Used vanilla JS instead of jQuery because I want to get better at it. I've used jQuery so much that I want to learn raw JS.
